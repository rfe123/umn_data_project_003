Team Project for creating a Visualization Dashboard using ETL and Visualization concepts from previous modules

## After identifying reliable datasets, we underwent a data refinement process employing Pandas and the "Data Wrangler" extension within VSCode. Once the data was cleansed and organized, we crafted a Python script. This script was designed to either establish a new SQLite database or connect to an existing one. It then proceeded to ingest data from a CSV file and integrate it into the SQLite database, creating a table where the "id" column was designated as the primary key.
Originally, our project had plans for an additional "Bonus" element. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this aspect remained unfinished. Hence, you may notice the existence of a second table labeled "UFO" within the database.
Subsequently, we developed a Python application utilizing the SQLAlchemy library to facilitate interaction with the SQLite database. To serve various endpoints, we harnessed the Flask micro-framework, which streamlined the handling of HTTP requests and responses.
